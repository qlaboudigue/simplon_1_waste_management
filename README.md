## Problem presentation / interpretation
Based on data about wastes generated by the population, the program aims at calculating the generated CO2 regarding the different machines available. Machines deal with specific types of waste.

### Set-up & source code
The project has been developped in Dart (POO language), using Flutter framework.
Runner available under ~/lib/main
Source code available under ~/lib

### Method
1) Basic modelisation of the problem (Inputs, main function, wanted outputs).
2) Modelisation of the business logic based on the POO(SOLID) principles.
3) Implementation of the model.
4) Import and decode input data from JSON.
5) Implementation of the WasteManager Class responsible for answering the core problem.
6) Display results.

### Progress
Day 1 : Read.me file creation et business logic modelisation on paper.
