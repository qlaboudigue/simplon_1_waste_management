# simplon_1_waste_management
Simplon waste management project (Brief #1)

### Problem presentation / interpretation
Based on data about wastes generated by the population, the program aims at calculating the generated CO2 regarding the different machines available. Machines deal with specific types of waste.

### Set-up & source code
- The project has been developped in Dart (POO language), using Flutter framework.
- Runner available under ~/lib/main
- Source code available under ~/lib

### Method & estimated time
1) Basic modelisation of the problem (Inputs, main function, wanted outputs) - (3 hours).
2) Modelisation of the business logic based on the POO(SOLID) principles - (2 hours).
3) Implementation of the model - (2 hours).
4) Import and decode input data from JSON - (4 hours).
5) Implementation of the WasteManager Class responsible for solving the core problem - (4 hours).
6) Display results - (4 hours).

### Progress & time spent per task
- Session 1 : Read.me file creation et business logic modelisation on paper (1 hour).
- Session 2 : Graphic modelisation of the business logic, not finished yet (3 hours).
- Session 3 : Tutorial about managing (decoding using classes) every situation in a .json file. (3 hours)
